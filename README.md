# docker-multichain

This is the repository for the kunstmaan/*-multichain docker images.

## Images

* [kunstmaan/base-multichain](https://hub.docker.com/r/kunstmaan/base-multichain/): A base Ubuntu with the latest Multichain deamon installed
* [kunstmaan/master-multichain](https://hub.docker.com/r/kunstmaan/master-multichain/): Based on the "base" image running a master node, creates a blockchain and runs it. *Important: only for development since any node can connect, anyone can administer and the RPC interface is open to all.*
* [kunstmaan/node-multichain](https://hub.docker.com/r/kunstmaan/node-multichain/): Based on the same "base" image and connects to the master node
* [kunstmaan/explorer-multichain](https://hub.docker.com/r/kunstmaan/explorer-multichain/): A node with the Multichain explorer installed

## Running the cluster

Use this [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Kunstmaan/docker-multichain/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) and run:

```
sudo docker-compose up
```


## Persisting your chain

Add a volume

<somewhere>:/root/.multichain

## Configuration

### Masternode

To configure your chain, we use environment variables.

#### Required

* CHAINNAME: DockerChain
* NETWORK_PORT: 7447       # also expose this port!
* RPC_PORT: 8000           # also expose this port!
* RPC_USER: multichainrpc
* RPC_PASSWORD: 79pgKQusiH3VDVpyzsM6e3kRz6gWNctAwgJvymG3iiuz
* RPC_ALLOW_IP: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0

#### Optional

* PARAM_<something descriptive>='<variable>|<value>' e.g: `PARAM_TARGET_BLOCK_SIZE='target-block-time|15'`

These variables can be set:
